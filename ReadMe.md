Loan Applicant Analysis Using Basic Statistics and R Visualizations

Description:
This project demonstrates the application of basic statistical techniques and data visualization in R to explore
trends in a dataset of loan applicants. It emphasizes the role of descriptive and inferential statistics in
uncovering patterns, relationships, and potential predictors of loan approval decisions. The workflow includes
data preprocessing, visual exploration, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing using a t-test.

Features:
*Data Import and Preprocessing: Load and structure CSV data for analysis using R.
*Visualizations: Generate histograms for income and payment behavior, and a boxplot for reliability.
Correlation Analysis: Build and visualize a Pearson Correlation Matrix to identify strong associations.
*Statistical Testing: Perform an independent t-test to examine the impact of credit score on loan decisions.
*Interpretation: Translate statistical output into business-relevant insights for decision making.

Research Question:
How do applicant features, specifically credit score, income, reliability, and payment history, influence
loan approval outcomes?

Analysis:
*Histograms: Missed/Late Payments: Revealed the distribution of applicant repayment behavior. Most applicants clustered around low
missed payments, suggesting generally reliable payers.

*Boxplot (Reliability): Provided insight into the central tendency and spread of reliability scores, pinpointing outliers and evaluating
applicant consistency from a statistical angle.

*Pearson Correlation Matrix: Used to identify the relationship between variables. Strong positive correlations (between Credit Score and Reliability) 
informed which features might be good predictors for loan decisions.

*Independent t-test (Credit Score vs Make Loan): Evaluated whether credit score significantly differs between approved and denied applicants. A statistically significant
result suggests that credit score plays a pivotal role in determining loan outcomes.
